## Description

I created this app to serve as a text editor that is able to function on and offline. Creating this PWA allowed me to gain experience with webpack configuration and plugins, asset caching with service workers, getting/storing data with the IndexedDB API, and setting up PWA installation.

## Usage

Once the user accesses the deployed app, they can begin using the text editor in their browser. The user can also select the install button in the top left-hand corner to install the web app as an icon on their computer desktop.
